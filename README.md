# EdiTools
PowerShell scripts for managing and parsing EDI files. Only certain X12 documents will be targeted initially.

This project has a few goals:

1. Create a PowerShell module to assist with managing EDI files. On my current project, many times I just want a quick answer to a questions e.g. how many accepted transaction sets vs. how many rejected, or claim count, or extracting an error message for a rejected transaction set. 
2. Gain experience with PowerShell
3. Gain experience with GitHub
4. Gain experience with open-source collaboration
